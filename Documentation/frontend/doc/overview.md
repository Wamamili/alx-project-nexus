Frontend Stack
Next.js

Next.js powers the application architecture. It delivers file based routing, server components, API routes, improved performance, and a smooth development workflow. It also simplifies SEO and data fetching patterns.

Tailwind CSS

Tailwind gives utility based styling that keeps the codebase consistent and easy to maintain. It removes the need for large CSS files and brings a predictable design system to every component.

TypeScript

TypeScript provides type safety across the project. It improves reliability and reduces runtime bugs. Interfaces and types give structure to API responses, components, and application logic. This supports long term maintainability of the codebase.

Purpose of the Frontend

The goal is to deliver a user friendly interface for browsing products, managing accounts, and completing orders. The structure focuses on strong UI patterns, easy scalability, and tight integration with backend APIs. This frontend serves as the main entry point for users accessing the ByteMtaani marketplace.
